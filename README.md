Credit Card Fraud Detection: Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions. Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results
